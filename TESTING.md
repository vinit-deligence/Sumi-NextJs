## Expected JSON Structure

```json
{
  "contacts": [
    {
      "input_contact": {
        "id": "temp_contact_1",
        "first_name": "John",
        "last_name": "Smith",
        "phone": "5551234",
        "email": "john@example.com",
        "stage": "Lead",
        "source": "sumiAgent",
        "intent": "add",
        "operation": "add",
        "appointments": [],
        "tasks": [],
        "notes": [],
        "validations": {
          "missing_fields": [],
          "invalid_fields": []
        }
      },
      "update_contact": {},
      "approved": false
    }
  ],
  "language": "english",
  "skip_to": ""
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Failed to process request"
- **Cause**: OpenAI API key not set or invalid
- **Solution**: Check your `.env.local` file and ensure the API key is correct

### Error: Rate limit exceeded
- **Cause**: Too many requests to OpenAI API
- **Solution**: Wait a moment and try again, or upgrade your OpenAI plan

### Empty or incorrect extraction
- **Cause**: Ambiguous query or model limitation
- **Solution**: Try rephrasing the query more clearly

## Performance Notes

- Each query makes 1 API call to OpenAI
- Response time: typically 1-3 seconds
- Cost per request: ~$0.0001 - $0.001 (depending on model and query length)
- Recommended model: `gpt-4o-mini` for cost efficiency, `gpt-4-turbo` for best accuracy
